This program reads a number of TIFF files (specified on standard input) and blends them into one large composite image, taking into account the 'XPosition' and 'YPosition' metadata in the TIFF files.

The blending is done by simply taking the median of all the input pixels corresponding to one output pixel. It will therefore need a lot of overlap to work well.

It is meant to operate on remapped images as generated by Hugin.
